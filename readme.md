# Eww Config

## What is it

Using [Eww Widgets](https://elkowar.github.io/eww/eww.html) to create a replacement for my `bumblebee-status` bars in `i3` Window Manager.

Eww allows you to create widgets and style them up with css. It's extremely flexible.

## Screenshots

### Top Bar

This is my top bar - workspaces are styled with icons from font-awesome and colour coded based on focus and urgency (red "Slack" workspace)

Music details are coming from `playerctl` which is picking up my playing try from `ncspot` (Spotify CLI)

### Bottom Bar

Keeping it simple on the bottom bar - 

Workspaces repeated again on the left. On the right we have memory usage, CPU avg usage and disk usage. Then we have my primary interface throughput captured.
